    <h2>Reflections on Twelve Pillars (Chapters 4–7)</h2>

    <!-- Chapter 4 -->
    <article class="chapter card" id="ch4">
      <h3>Chapter 4 — Achieve Your Goals</h3>
      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Jim Rohn emphasizes that goals are the foundation of achievement. Without them, people tend to wander through life, reacting instead of directing. Goals create a roadmap, give purpose, and serve as motivation during difficult times. Importantly, goals should be written down, measurable, and broken into smaller steps. Success does not come by accident—it is the result of intentional planning and action toward a vision.</p>
      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>To align these points in my life, I can set academic and career goals such as completing my degree with a high GPA, securing internships, mastering a specific programming language, or aiming to become a software engineer, data scientist, or cybersecurity expert. Writing these down and breaking them into smaller milestones (daily coding practice, completing projects, networking with tech professionals) ensures consistent progress.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 5 -->
    <article class="chapter card" id="ch5">
      <h3>Chapter 5 — The Proper Use of Time</h3>
      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Time is the most valuable resource because it cannot be regained once lost. Many people fail not because they lack ability, but because they misuse their time. Rohn suggests prioritizing activities that bring long-term benefits rather than short-term pleasures. Success comes from discipline, focus, and making daily choices that align with one’s goals. The difference between successful and unsuccessful people often lies in how they spend their 24 hours each day.</p>
      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>University life is filled with distractions, but using time wisely is crucial. I can create structured study schedules, limit wasted hours on social media or gaming, and dedicate consistent blocks of time to coursework, side projects, and career development. By practicing discipline now, they build habits that will serve them in their career.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 6 -->
    <article class="chapter card" id="ch6">
      <h3>Chapter 6 — Surround Yourself with the Best People</h3>
      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Our environment shapes us. The attitudes, habits, and values of the people around us strongly influence our own behavior. By surrounding ourselves with positive, disciplined, and goal-oriented individuals, we raise our own standards. Conversely, staying around negative or unmotivated people drags us down. Mentorship, strong friendships, and professional networks all play critical roles in growth.</p>
      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>Success in tech often comes from collaboration and networking. I can intentionally join coding clubs, hackathons, and study groups with motivated peers. I can also seek mentors among professors, alumni, or industry professionals. By surrounding themselves with driven individuals, I will stay motivated and open to opportunities.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 7 -->
    <article class="chapter card" id="ch7">
      <h3>Chapter 7 — Be a Lifelong Learner</h3>
      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>True success is not just about reaching a destination—it’s about constantly growing. Learning must not stop after formal education; instead, continuous self-improvement keeps us adaptable in a changing world. This means reading books, listening to ideas from experts, attending seminars, and developing new skills. Rohn insists that the habit of lifelong learning separates those who plateau early from those who achieve lasting success.</p>
      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>Computer science is one of the fastest-changing fields. Beyond classroom learning, I can commit to lifelong learning by exploring online courses, reading tech blogs, experimenting with new frameworks, and staying updated on industry trends. This ensures that I remain relevant and competitive in the job market.</p>
