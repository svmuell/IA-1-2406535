        <h2>My Mentors</h2>
        <p>The most impactful mentors in my life are undoubtedly my parents. From birth to the present day, they have stood by my side, guiding me through challenges and always striving to do their best for me. I have witnessed the many sacrifices they have made for the well-being of our family, and I am deeply grateful for their unwavering support. They have protected me from countless difficulties and serve as role models in many aspects of my life. Their influence has significantly shaped the person I am today, and without them, I cannot imagine where I would be.
          A personal motto that I will always cherish from my father is, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit.” He consistently emphasized the importance of excellence and instilled in me the belief that I should strive to embody it in all aspects of my life. I hold his words close to my heart and remain committed to pursuing excellence in everything I undertake.

        <h2>AI Businesses 2025 — Idea Review</h2>
        <p>AI-powered content creation uses machine learning (large language models, diffusion models, etc.) to generate text, images, audio, video and design assets quickly and at scale. For a university student studying computer science, these tools can speed writing and prototyping, help with idea generation and documentation, assist learning (code explanations, summarisation), and raise the quality of deliverables — if used responsibly. However, the technology raises ethical risks (misinformation/hallucinations, plagiarism and academic dishonesty, bias, privacy, and deepfakes). A practical solution combines policy, technical controls, and education: require attribution and human review, use detection and watermarking where possible, adopt clear academic rules, and teach students how to evaluate and correct AI outputs.
          An example of AI-powered content creation app is Jasper. Jasper is an AI platform built for marketing and content generation. Jasper is widely used by creators and teams for drafting jobs, blog posts, ad copy and marketing assets.
